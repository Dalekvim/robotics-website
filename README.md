# The Robotics Website
You wouldn't believe how hard is to make, but it's a lot of fun. If you're from the College and want to join the Robotics Club or be a part of this project, don't hesitate to let me know.

For information on how the website was made, ckeck out the [Wiki](https://github.com/Dalekvim/robotics-website/wiki).
