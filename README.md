# The Robotics Website
You wouldn't believe how hard hard was to make, but it was a lot of fun.   
If you're from the College and you think you can make some improvements to my code, please do so.   
If you're good with API calls, focus on the comment section because that part's really complicated and buggy.

I won't be making any changes to the website for a while since programming really deteriorates my health, but I am more than willing to listen to any ideas for improvements.
